Hello, I'm a MARYAM RASHEED, BSCS student with a unique background in med. I bring a strong work ethic and excellent communication skills to the table.
# Outside of academia, I enjoy cooking, observing the world around me, and being a good listener. I find joy in watching Netflix and cherish moments spent with my mother.
My goals include nurturing a beautiful soul as a mother, delving into human psychology, and learning to play the piano and violin.
