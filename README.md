Hello, I'm a MARYAM RASHEED, BSCS student with a unique background in med. I bring a strong work ethic and excellent communication skills to the table. Outside of academia, I enjoy cooking, observing the world around me, and being a good listener. I find joy in watching Netflix and cherish moments spent with my mother.
